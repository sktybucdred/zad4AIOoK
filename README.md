Angular Student Management Application:

Initial Setup: Generated project structure and configured a component with a custom selector.
Student List Component: Created a Student class with properties such as name, age, and grades. Implemented a list of students with dynamic display features including conditional formatting for negative grades and expandable details on click.
Add Student Functionality: Developed an AddStudent component to input new students, excluding grades initially, with rendering on demand.
Edit Student Functionality: Added an EditStudent component allowing modification of existing student details, with pre-filled fields and functionality to add new grades interactively.
